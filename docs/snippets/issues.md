## Issues

If you wish to work on an open issue, please comment on the issue with `.take` and it will be assigned to you. If an issue is not assigned, it is assumed to be open for anyone to work on. Please assign yourself to an issue before beginning work on it to avoid conflicts.

If you are contributing to the project for the first time, please consider checking the [bug](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22%F0%9F%90%9B+bug%22) or [good first issue](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) labels.

In case you get stuck, please feel free to ask for help in the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/U2peSNf23P) server or GitHub Discussions.




**Issues** allow authors to get user/community feedback to keep their code or document(s) up to date with the literature, address issues, add features that other users want to use for their research.

* Issues are public (on a public repository), so these conversations are transparent.
* Issues also allow tracking of questions, bug reporting, suggestions and feature requests, which are often overlooked as contributions.
* You can also assign specific people to address issues as they arise, which helps to manage who works on what.


**Pull requests** allow for contributions from within the team or from other contributors (in a trackable way).

* Issues and pull requests are easily linked to each other (e.g. "This PR addresses #1").
* Pull requests are checked before including the changes into the "main" version of the project, to avoid "breaking" things accidentally. You can assign certain people to validate pull requests before they can be *merged* into the project.
* This opens the door to external contributors, who can submit code (or writing). 

Issues and pull-requests are at the heart of GitHub's appeal for collaboration and open science. 

### :lady_beetle: Issues
[Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues) are used to track tasks that contributors can help with. If an issue has a triage label, we haven't reviewed it yet, and you shouldn't begin work on it.

If you've found something in the content or the website that should be updated, search open issues to see if someone else has reported the same thing. If it's something new, open an issue using a [template](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/new/choose). We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/new/choose).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/github/docs/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. See "[Label reference](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/collaborating-on-github-docs/label-reference)" for more information. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Don't forget to use the "[Self review checklist](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/collaborating-on-github-docs/self-review-checklist) to speed up the review process :zap:.
