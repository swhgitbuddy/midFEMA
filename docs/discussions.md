### :mega: Discussions
Discussions are where we have conversations.

If you'd like help troubleshooting a docs PR you're working on, have a great new idea, or want to share something amazing you've learned in our docs, join us in [discussions](https://github.com/github/docs/discussions).

This is a new tool that is being introduced to GitHub, which is intended as a way to keep broader conversations open. For example, people can discuss a project at a conceptual level, have more in-depth discussions about what outputs *mean* (or don't mean), and more. This is another way of tracking and showcasing contributions outside of code or writing, which are often left out because they happen in private email chains or are simply hard to keep track of.

You can take a peek on the [Discussions](https://github.com/pedrohbraga/SORTEE-Hackathon-Dynamic-Collaboration/discussions) tab for this repository. But, here are some examples of Github Discussions:

* [Problems in how we use data/GIS](https://github.com/albertkun/21S-ASIAAM-191A/discussions/24)
* [Why SPEI?](https://github.com/HaireLab/community-stress-gradients/discussions/4)
