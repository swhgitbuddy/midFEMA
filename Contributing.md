If this library helps you, you may want to consider
[buying the maintainer a cup of coffee](https://flattr.com/submit/auto?user_id=ivanperez-keera&url=https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/Yampa&title=Yampa&language=&tags=github&category=software).

## Discussions, issues and pull requests
<sup>[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)</sup>

**Discussions**

If you have any comments, questions, ideas, or other topics that you think will
be of interest to the Yampa community, start a new discussion
[here](https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/Yampa/discussions). Examples include:

- You've created a new game or application that uses Yampa.
- You've written or found a library that helps use Yampa in a particular
  domain, or apply it to a specific platform.
- You've written or found a paper that mentions Yampa.
- You have an idea for an extension that will enable writing programs that are
  not currently possible or convenient to capture.
- You think you've found a bug.
- You want to propose an improvement (e.g., make the code faster or smaller).
- You have a question.
- Something in the documentation, a tutorial or a Yampa / FRP paper is unclear.
- You like the project and want to introduce yourself.

**Issues**

If a specific change is being proposed (either a new feature or a bug fix), you
can *open an issue* documenting the proposed change
[here](https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/Yampa/issues).

If you are unsure about whether your submission should be filed as an issue or
as a discussion, file it as a discussion. We can always move it later.

**Pull requests**

Once we determine that an issue will be addressed, we'll decide who does it and
when the change will be added to Yampa. Even if you implement the solution,
someone will walk you through the steps to ensure that your submission conforms
with our version control process, style guide, etc. More information on our
process is included below.

Please, do not just send a PR unless there is an issue for it and someone from
the Yampa team has confirmed that you should address it. The PR is *very*
likely to be rejected, and we really want to accept your contributions, so it
will make us very sad. Open a discussion / issue first and let us guide you
through the process.

**[dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/)** enables data analysts and engineers to transform their data using the same practices that software engineers use to build applications.

![architecture](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/202cb7e51e218c7b29eb3b11ad058bd56b7739de/etc/dbt-transform.png)

## Understanding dbt

Analysts using dbt can transform their data by simply writing select statements, while dbt handles turning these statements into tables and views in a data warehouse.

These select statements, or "models", form a dbt project. Models frequently build on top of one another â€“ dbt makes it easy to [manage relationships](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/ref) between models, and [visualize these relationships](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/documentation), as well as assure the quality of your transformations through [testing](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/testing).

## Getting started

- [Install dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/get-started/installation)
- Read the [introduction](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/introduction/) and [viewpoint](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/about/viewpoint/)

## Join the dbt Community

- Be part of the conversation in the [dbt Community Slack](http://community.getdbt.com/)
- Read more on the [dbt Community Discourse](https://discourse.getdbt.com)

## Reporting bugs and contributing code
